    <h4> Hello! Welcome to my Cybernetics Project.</h4>

    <p> Today I will show you around the simple and friendly website I am creating. <br> </p>
    <p> In this Website you should not expect to find:</p>

    <ul>
        <li> A professional looking site like the one I could have created in Wix.</li>
        <li> Any sense of cybersecurity, saving on a data base or some complex activity that an actual
            functioning webpage has. </li>
        <li> Cats </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Instead, what you should be expecting are:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li> Lots of bugs. </li>
        <li> A learning process. </li>
        <li> Dogs. </li>
    </ul>
    

    <h2> How this Website was created: </h2> 

    <p> The creation of this website has been ardous and stressing just because most of the time I am not
        relly sure of what am I doing. It has been consistently been made on a "trial and error" basis. 
    </p>

    <h2> Definitions: </h2>
    <p> There are two main programming languages that are being used in this webpage:<br> </p>
    <h3> HTML </h3>
    <p> <br> We use HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) in a webiste to declare the behavior of the website. 
        We tell it what elements it should display, how they should be orderd and where should it search 
        from them.</p>
    <h3> CSS </h3>
    <p> <br> CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document. 
        CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
        It is mainly concerned for the formatting of the elements of the webpage. 
        CSS needs HTML elements to work. </p>

    <p> <br> <br> <br> Still, it is always a better idea to look at the actual code to understand it better. So let's 
    get to it! <br> </p>
