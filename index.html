    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hello acquaintances and strangers from the Internet. I am Miguel. I am a native from Mexico City who has a lot of interests. 
        I should really know what to say here and have some catchy or at least funny phrases but I haven't figured out what it is that 
        I want to share with the world. Meanwhile, enjoy this half-done Website, which I hope eventually turns out to be somehow useful. 
    </p>
